# DIGHUM101-2025

Welcome to Python Programming for Digital Humanities, UC Berkeley Summer 2025, taught by Merve Tekgürler.

## Software Installations and Set Up

*Please have this complete before first day*

In this class, we will learn to use the programming language Python. Just as you use a text editor like Microsoft Word for writing, you'll need a code editor to write and manage your code. In our case, we’ll be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a user-friendly and free editor designed for programming.
To install and manage additional tools or libraries (also called packages) that extend Python’s functionality, we will use a package manager—specifically, Conda. Conda allows us to install, update, and organize the various packages we’ll need throughout the course.
Finally, we will be using GitHub, a platform for sharing and collaborating on code. GitHub allows you to store your code in the cloud, track changes over time, and work with others on shared projects, similar to Google Docs.

Please follow the steps below to install the required software:

- [] Python
- If you are using a MacBook, you should already have Python installed on your computer.
- If you are using Windows, please follow the instructions here to install [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- Make sure that you are running Python 3.12
- [] GitHub
- Use your student email address to create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- Follow the instructions on [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/education/about-github-education/github-education-for-students/apply-to-github-education-as-a-student) to apply for a GitHub Pro account, which is free for students
- [] Virtual Studio Code
- Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Sign in VS Code with your GitHub account
- [] Miniconda
- Download [Miniconda Installer](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) You have to scroll all the way down to the Miniconda installer
- Make sure to choose the correct Miniconda for your computer (Windows vs Mac) and your chip architecture (Mac Intel or Mac Apple).
Refer to [getting started](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) and [installation](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install) guides for questions
